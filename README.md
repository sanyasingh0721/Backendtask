Project Overview
This tool fetches research papers from PubMed based on a user query and identifies papers with at least one author affiliated with a pharmaceutical or biotech company. The results are saved in a CSV file for easy analysis.

 1. How the Code is Organized
The project is structured as follows:

ğŸ“‚ pubmed_fetcher/ (Main package)

ğŸ“„ fetch.py â†’ Handles API requests to fetch research papers.

ğŸ“„ filter.py â†’ Identifies industry-affiliated authors using heuristics.

ğŸ“„ export.py â†’ Saves the filtered data to a CSV file.

ğŸ“„ utils.py â†’ Helper functions (e.g., API error handling, logging).

ğŸ“‚ cli/ (Command-line interface)

ğŸ“„ main.py â†’ Parses user input, calls fetch & filter functions, and manages output.

ğŸ“‚ tests/ (Test cases)

ğŸ“„ test_fetch.py â†’ Tests API data retrieval.

ğŸ“„ test_filter.py â†’ Tests author affiliation filtering.

ğŸ“„ test_export.py â†’ Tests CSV file creation.

ğŸ“„ pyproject.toml â†’ Defines dependencies (managed by Poetry).
ğŸ“„ README.md â†’ Instructions and project details.


 2. Installing Dependencies & Running the Program
Install Dependencies
Use Poetry to install all required packages:
